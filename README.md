## Project Vision & Goals

This project represents an ambitious expansion from a single-game utility to a **comprehensive multi-game information hub**. My objectives include:

1. **Multi-Game Architecture:** Design a scalable backend capable of handling multiple game APIs and data sources
2. **Real-Time Data Processing:** Implement efficient systems for live data updates from both Destiny 2 and Warframe
3. **Advanced Mobile Development:** Master complex state management across different game contexts and data types
4. **API Design Excellence:** Create robust, well-documented APIs that can serve multiple frontend applications
5. **Performance Optimization:** Handle large datasets (Destiny 2 Manifest) while maintaining fast response times
6. **Portfolio Showcase:** Demonstrate full-stack capabilities and multi-platform integration skills

### **Game Coverage Strategy**

**Phase 1 (Current):** Destiny 2 Xûr - ✅ **LIVE**
**Phase 2 (In Progress):** All Destiny 2 Vendors
**Phase 3 (Planned):** Warframe World State Integration
**Phase 4 (Future):** Enhanced Features & Additional Games
